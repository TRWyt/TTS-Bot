# TTS-Bot
Using a python library I was able to take inspiration from my discord spam bot and make it to where instead of typing the entire bee movie script 1 line at a time it reads the entire thing to you only way to stop it is by turning off your computer or just wait for it to end.
Do what ever you want with this. Mess with your friends, send this to random people, or just excecute it whenever you're bored.
